<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When creating a map,&nbsp;
it is first necessary to define what sort of skirmish it will be appropriate for. In The Knight Shift there are three game types so the following
criteria must be included for each of them:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Destroy buildings</b> – standard skirmishes. There must be at least two starting points on the map.<br>
<br>
<b>Battle</b> – along with starting points, the map must  include markers (one for each player.)Their task is to show the position where the Court appears after the game
has been started.  The marker cannot be placed on roads, water, rocks or sand etc.
It needs to be placed in such a position that there is a lot of free space around it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>RPG mode</b> –the map for this mode must satisfy certain conditions. See chapter: RPG Mode Map<br>
